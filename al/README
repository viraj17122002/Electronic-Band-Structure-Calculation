It has the following three steps:

1) Calculate the self consistent field after optimising the structure.
pw.x   <  al.scf.in > al.scf.out


2) Calculate the non-self consistent field using a denser k-mesh.
pw.x <  al.band1.in > al.band1.out


3) Convert the data into a x-y format using the following:
bands.x <  al.band2.in > al.band2.out
